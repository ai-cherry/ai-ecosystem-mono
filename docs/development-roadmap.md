# üóìÔ∏è AI-Ecosystem-Mono Development Roadmap

## üìÖ Implementation Timeline

This roadmap outlines the planned implementation schedule for addressing the remaining critical gaps identified in the health check report. Each component has an estimated timeline, assigned owner, and specific acceptance criteria.

| **LangSmith Tracing** | DevOps | 2 days | ‚Ä¢ Traces visible in LangSmith console<br>‚Ä¢ Complete span context propagation<br>‚Ä¢ Cost tracking per workflow type |
| **Token Budget Controls** | ML Ops | 3 days | ‚Ä¢ Configurable token caps per agent/workflow<br>‚Ä¢ Usage tracking metrics<br>‚Ä¢ Graceful handling when limits reached |

### Sprint 2

| Component | Owner | Estimate | Acceptance Criteria |

## üö® Risk Mitigation Plan

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| **Agent implementation delays** | Start with LeadResearchAgent as a template for others; modularize common functionality |
| **LangSmith integration issues** | Prepare fallback logging mechanism; engage LangChain support team early |
| **Cost control effectiveness** | Start with shadow mode that logs but doesn't block; A/B test with small percentage of traffic |
| **Test flakiness** | Implement deterministic fixtures; record/replay for LLM responses; add tolerance for semantic similarity |
| **Resource constraints** | Prioritize work based on business impact; consider bringing in contractor resources for lower-priority items |

## üèÅ Definition of Done

For each component to be considered complete, it must meet the following criteria:

1. ‚úÖ **Functionality**: All specified features are implemented and working
2. ‚úÖ **Testing**: Unit and integration tests with >80% coverage
3. ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Code comments, docstrings, and updated architecture diagrams
4. ‚úÖ **Security**: Passes security review and adheres to best practices
5. ‚úÖ **Performance**: Meets performance benchmarks under expected load
6. ‚úÖ **Observability**: Proper logging, tracing, and monitoring integration

## üìà Success Metrics

The implementation of these components will be measured by the following success metrics:

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Agent Task Success Rate | N/A | >90% | Sprint 3 |
| LLM Cost per Workflow | Unknown | <$0.50 | After Token Budget Controls |
| Mean Time to Debug (MTTD) | Hours | <30 mins | After LangSmith Tracing |
| Vector DB Size Growth | Unbounded | <5% weekly | After VectorJanitor Enhancement |
| Test Success Rate in CI | 92% | >99% | After Deterministic Testing |

## üîÑ Weekly Review Process

To ensure steady progress:

1. **Daily Standups**: 15-minute check-ins focused on blockers
2. **Weekly Demo**: Show working functionality to stakeholders
3. **Bi-weekly Retrospective**: Identify process improvements
4. **Architecture Review**: Before each new component is deployed to production
